    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this bootcamp is to build a complete end-to-end computer vision pipeline for an object detection application. This material will introduce participants to multiple NVIDIA® SDKs, most notably NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, NVIDIA TensorRT™, NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server, and NVIDIA DeepStream SDK while giving hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, optimization, and deployment at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key objective of this bootcamp is to show participants how to seamlessly combine these SDKs so that the same development methodology can be applied to similar use cases as well, even outside the domain of computer vision. With a broader idea of the production flow, participants will be able to better evaluate the complexity and progress of their machine learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootcamp assumes familiarity with Deep Learning and Computer Vision fundamentals.\n",

    "* Frameworks: NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, NVIDIA TensorRT, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, OpenCV\n",

    "It is not required, although useful, to have more than one GPU for the bootcamp. Let's start by testing the GPUs you are running the code on in this bootcamp:"

The material was also tested using a workstation equipped with an NVIDIA RTX A3000 GPU with 6GB of VRAM, reducing all the batch sizes to 8 during training. The results may vary when using different hardware and some hyperparameters may not be ideal for fully taking advantage of the graphic card.*"
